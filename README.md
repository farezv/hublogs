Hublogs
=======

A project that consumes the GitHub api to bring you a list of developer profiles, with important information that helps you connect with them. The primary purpose was to find a list of developer blogs, but I have some other ideas. 

You can currently search by the following:
* GitHub username
* GitHub organization name

Here's a brief roadmap of features I'd like to add:
* Redis cache
* Search by username/repository or orgname/repository

Sample app running on [Heroku](http://hublogs.farezv.com)
